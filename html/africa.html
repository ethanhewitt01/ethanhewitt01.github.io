    <h1 class="display-3">African Music</h1>
    <p class="lead">Its time to learn about the African style of music </p>

    <h2>African music</h2>
    <p>The traditional music of Africa, given the vastness of the continent, is historically ancient, rich and diverse, with different regions and nations
      of Africa having many distinct musical traditions. Music in Africa is very important when it comes to religion. Songs and music are used in rituals
      and religious ceremonies, to pass down stories from generation to generation, as well as to sing and dance to.</p>

    <p>Like the music of Asia, India and the Middle East, it's a highly rhythmic music. In fact, the only music in the world that isn't rhythmically complex
      is Western music. African music consists of complex rhythmic patterns, often involving one rhythm played against another to create a Polyrhythm.
       The most common Polyrhythm plays three beats on top of two, like a triplet played against straight notes. beyond the rhythmic nature of the music, African music
       differs from Western music in that the various parts of the music do not necessarily combine in a harmonious fashion. African musicians unlike Western musicians,
       do not seek to combine different sounds in a way that is pleasing to the ear</p>

    <p>Traditional music in most of the continent is passed down orally or aurally and is not written. In Sub-Saharan African music traditions, it frequently relies on
      percussion instruments of every variety, including xylophones, djembes, drums, and tone-producing instruments such as the mbira or "thumb piano.</p>

      <p> below is some traditional music of africa so you can have a listen to it</p>

    <h2> Traditional African instruments</h3>

    <h3>Djembe</h3>
    <img src="../img/African_djembe.jpg" style="width:50%" alt="A djembe">
    <p>A djembe or jembe is a rope-tuned skin-covered goblet drum played with bare hands, originally from West Africa</p>

    <h3>Flutes</h3>
    <img src="../img/flute.jpg" style="width:50%" alt="image of a flute">
    <p> just like in celtic music flutes are used. The flute is a wind instrument which is held vertically or horizontally so the breath of the player
      strikes a narrow edge. flutes were not made for folk music but were adapted to it instead it was used for
      dance music.</p>

    <h3>fiddle</h3>
    <img src="../img/fiddle.jpg" style="width:50%" alt="A fiddle">
    <p>Again this is an instrument also used in celtic music.  fiddle is a bow stringed instrument, it is like a violin but with a difference
    the difference between the two is the bridge. A fiddles bridge is flatter then that of a violin. This is because in folk music (such as the
    celtic music) the fiddle players will need use of more then one string at once.</p>
