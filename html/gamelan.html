    <p class="lead">Its time to learn about gamelan styles of music. </p>

    <h2>Gamelan music</h2>
    <p>One of the most influential types of music-making in Indonesia is that of Gamelan.
      Gamelan describes a type of ‘orchestra’ made up mainly of tuned percussion instruments,
      which often accompanies performances of rod or shadow puppetry.</p>

    <p>The music is made up of interlocking layers. Each layer is played by a different instrument. The layers
       are usually based on a core melodic line called a balungan. The texture is heterophonic. Gamelan music is
       characterised by the following: the lower the pitch, the longer the note values, the highest layers are for
       virtuoso solo instruments played with notes of shorter duration the lowest gongs are often played by beginners,
       the music is divided into four beat groups called keteg, gongs of different sizes are used to mark cycles of music
       known as the gongan </p>

    <p>Music in China is strongly influenced by philosophy and concepts of important historical thinkers such as Confucius.
      Music is considered a highly calming influence, examples of this approach being space and fluency in performance.
      Sometimes there are moments of silence within the performance, which facilitates engagement and a connection between audience
      and players.</p>
