    <p class="lead">So you probarly have questions about the site such as, why was it made,
    who was it made for and can you give any ideas for the site that you think would be good.</p>

    <p>The answer to the first question of why was it made is simple. The site world of music
    was made so that people can find out about the whole world of music that they have around them
    the site was also made so that it would teach people ages 13-21 about the world of music for their
    gcse exams. The answer to the second question who was it made for is also simple. it was made for
    everyone that is intreauged in music but it is also mainly for gcse students learning about
    the world of music. The final question of can you give ideas to the site is yes. if you use our
    navigation bar at the top and go to the contact us page you can get the email address to send
    your ideas too, or look at the footer for the link to the page, prehaps you could use the button below
    which would probarly be more convenient.</p>
