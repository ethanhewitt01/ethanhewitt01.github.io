    style of music they've both produce. many celtic musicians like paddy moloney have
    said that all the generes of celtic music are actully quite similar. in celtic music
    it is very normal for the melodic line to move up and down the primary chords.</p>

      These include; Scotland, ireland, brittany and wales. These places keep hold of the
      traditions such as the language (gaelic) and the music.</p>
