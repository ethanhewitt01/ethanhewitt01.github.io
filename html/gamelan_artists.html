           <p>Christine Southworth (b. Boston, Massachusetts, 2 January 1978) is an American composer of postminimal music and works with combinations of Western ensembles,
             electronics, and world music ensembles including Balinese gamelan and bagpipes. She performs Balinese gamelan and gender wayang with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
             Gamelan Galak Tika, as well as Galician Gaita and Great Highland Bagpipes. She co-founded Ensemble Robot, a cooperative of engineers, artists and musicians working

             with Balinese gamelan and with technology and electronics, as well as reaching beyond these influences with an expanded palette of contemporary classical, jazz
             and rock, and world music from Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe. To learn more about Christine click the button below to view his wiki page.</p>

           <p>Lou Silver Harrison (May 14, 1917 â€“ February 2, 2003) was an American composer. Harrison is particularly noted for incorporating elements of the music of non-Western
              cultures into his work, with a number of pieces written for Javanese style gamelan instruments, including ensembles constructed and tuned by Harrison and his partner
              William Colvig. The majority of his works are written in just intonation rather than the more widespread equal temperament. Harrison is one of the most prominent
              composers to have worked with microtones. To learn more about Lou go to his wiki page using the button below.</p>
